To start a Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Install Streamlit:
     pip install streamlit
    'if you don't already have it installed!'

2. Run the app in Terminal with this command:
     streamlit run my_app.py

OBS: my_app.py is the app/filename.


This will launch the app in your web browser. You can then interact with the app and make changes to the code, which will be reflected in the browser in real-time.

For more information on building Streamlit apps, check out the Streamlit documentation.
